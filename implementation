Setting up new application on server with supervisor

Login to server
Install virtualenv if not instaled : sudo aptitude install python-virtualenv
Switch user to CredTechOps  :   sudo su - CredTechOps
git clone application repository. For example : git clone http://github.com/Credr/example
Go to application and create virtual environment  : cd example; virtualenv . ;
Go to virtual env : source bin/activate
Install required packages to application using pip : pip install -r requirements.txt
Install gunicorn if not added in requirement.txt file : pip install gunicorn
Creating bash script to set some configuration and parameters : vim bin/gunicorn_start
Copy and paste configuration gunicorn_start file : https://github.com/mohitchhazed/example/gunicorn_start
Set the executable bit on the gunicorn_start script : sudo chmod u+x bin/gunicorn_start
Test your gunicorn_start script by running it. Make sure you are in virtual env with credrTechOps user
credrTechOps@django:~$ bin/gunicorn_start
Starting and monitoring your application with Supervisor : sudo aptitude install supervisor
When Supervisor is installed you can give it programs to start and watch by creating configuration files 
in the /etc/supervisor/conf.d directory. 
For our example application we’ll create a file named /etc/supervisor/conf.d/example.conf with this content:
[program:example]
Create the file to store your application’s log messages :
credrTechOps@django:~$ mkdir -p /webapps/hello_django/logs/
credrTechOps@django:~$ touch /webapps/hello_django/logs/gunicorn_supervisor.log
After you save the configuration file for your program you can ask supervisor to reread configuration files and update (which will start your the newly registered app).
$sudo supervisorctl reread
example: available
$ sudo supervisorctl update
example: added process group
You can also check the status of your app or start, stop or restart it using supervisor
$ sudo supervisorctl status hello                       
example                            RUNNING    pid 18020, uptime 0:00:50
$ sudo supervisorctl stop example  
example: stopped
$ sudo supervisorctl start example                        
example: started
$ sudo supervisorctl restart example 
example: stopped
hello: started
